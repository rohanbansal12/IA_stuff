\section{Hypothesis}

\textbf{Increasing the temperature of the reaction between iodine solution and acetone in the presence of hydrocholoric acid catalyst will directly increase the rate of the reaction.}

As discussed earlier, the increase in temperature with the addition of a catalyst allows for a larger proportion of molecules to have sufficient energy greater than the activation energy and induces more frequent successful collisions, resulting in a quicker rate~\parencite{general_catalysts}. The exact activation energy will be determined by the experiment and the hypothesis can then simultaneously be confirmed or rejected.
